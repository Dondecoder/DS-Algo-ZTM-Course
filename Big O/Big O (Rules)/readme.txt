Rule 1 of Big O 
    is that Big O focuses on the worst case scenario. For example when running a for loop. Finding the Big O of the loop 
    focuses on what would the run time be if the thing you are searching for in the for loop is in the furthest location of the loop for 
    example let's say you have an arry of 15 items and you are searching for a name in the array. Let's say the name is sarah. Big O would 
    be more focused on the run time of the code if sarah was the last name in the array. In a nutshell big O focuses on worst case scenario 
    not the best case. 


Rule 2 of Big O 
    is to remove the constants. When calculating Big O remove the constants and focus on what the inital runtime will be with out the 
    constants if the big O of an equation is Big O (6 + 5n). That can just be translated to the Big (O) = Big O(n). No need for the 
    constants. 

Rule 3 of Big O 
    different notation for different arrays. A good rule of thumb is that different inputs should have different variables. 

Rule 4 of Big O:
