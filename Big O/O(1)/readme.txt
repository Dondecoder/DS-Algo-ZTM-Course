Big O(1) means constant time which means that there is only one operation being done at a time or the equation is only run once. Please
refer to lines 1 -2. Using big O notation the formula is only run once to calculate big O. No matter the size of the variable boxes
the equation will always pick the first integer or variable in the boxes array. so that is O(1). Please look at lines 13 - 40 for reference
on calculating Big O. When working out the runtime of a problem it may easier going through each line step by step to find the answer
to the problems.
