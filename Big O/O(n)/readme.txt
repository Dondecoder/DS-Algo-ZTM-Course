This function in main.py takes O(n) to find this function or linear time it just means that the big O depends on the number of inputs
or fish in this example. The run time changes based on the amount of variables or data in the array/list. As the list/array increases 
so does the Big O. N = size of the input in compared to the amount of operations that it's doing.
